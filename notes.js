//Utilizing Tailwind CSS

//Lazy Loading - The practice of only loading images when they are in view -- no need to load everything 

//Next Config file
    //Need to add domains for sites going to use images

//Tailwind is mobile first

//Server Side Rendering
    //User will hit the URL - So request made to server
    //Server will build and execute the page and then delivered to user
    //Great for SEO
